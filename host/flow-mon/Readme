#Builds flow-mon binary

make

#Once build is successfull
#Currently flowmon works and also tested for k-ary fat-tree topology. 

./flowmon <k value> <inteface name>

#For example with k=4 and local interface is vnet0 
#./flowmon 4 vnet0

#If build is not successful or see segmentation errors while try to launch binary,
#it tells there is some issue with dependency libraries. Please look at install.sh, 
#located in pathdump root directory. Does it installed libraries with out errors ?
