# Switch rule generation

Openflow rule generation for tracing packet trajectory.

## How to create flow rules

```
./generateScripts.py <topology file> [-f]
```

\<topology file\> is a network topology file. An example topology file is given
in config/topology.yaml. Note that the topology describes the testbed setup used
by the PathDump team at the University of Edinburgh.

When -f option is omitted, the script creates two types of rules; i) forwarding
rules and ii) [CherryPick](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2775066) rules (the
rules to tag switches IDs in order to trace packet trajectory). In order to
create simple forwarding rules only, use -f flag.


## How to install flow rules

```
./install_rules.sh -r
```

The flow rules generated by generateScripts.py are stored in 'script' directory.
This install_rules.sh script executes the scripts stored in the 'script'
directory.

To show help menu, run ./install_rules.sh -h.


## Note

Note that this script is also tailored for the testbed setup at the University
of Edinburgh. The testbed comprises of Pica8 switches, which support SSH. This
script installs the generated flow rules via SSH. Hence, it is quite handy to
set up an SSH key at those switches.
